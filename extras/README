devps.tas - cyrrilic font metrics for groff.

koi8-r.tmac, ru.tmac - macros files for groff for cyrillic support.
ruhyphal.tex - as in a name, it is hyphenation description for cyrillic words.

koi8-r.tmac, ru.tmac and ruhyphal.tex should be put in /usr/share/groff/site-tmac or wherever site-tmac directory for groff is located.

Fontmap - file, which maps additional font-files for Ghostscript. In most linux distribution there is not need in this file, because when installing *gsfonts* package, package itself creates this mapping, so it is quite hided from user. 
	But, for example, in Cygwin (for current moment) this mapping is not created, so we need to handle it for our own. In this file "typical" Type1 font-files are assumed to be located in /usr/share/fonts/Type1/.
	And, as for Cygwin, Ghostscript is not looking for fontmap-file in /var/lib/ghostscript/fonts, so you can put this file in /usr/share/fonts/Type1.
